## First tests

We need to start out with creating two folders that will hold our spec(test) files and our implementation files. 

`$Â mkdir src` To hold our implementation files

`$ mkdir spec` To hold our spec files

Create a new file in your `spec` folder. Call it `person_spec.js`.

```
$ touch spec/person_spec.js
```

*** Note that I use the `snake case` format for my file names. You are free to use any format you want but be consistent. ***

We are going to write two test for our Person object. In order to calculate the BMI, we will be needing a Person to have two attributes, `weight` and `height`.

```javascript
# spec/person_spec.js

describe("Person", function() {
  let person;

  beforeEach(function() {
    person = new Person({weight: 90, height: 186});
  });

  it("should have weight of 90", function() {
    expect(person.weight).equal(90);
  });

  it("should have height of 186", function() {
    expect(person.height).equal(186);
  });
});
```

If you reload your `SpecRunner.html` you'll get two errors. 



Let's implement the code that makes this test pass.

In your `src` folder, create a file called `person.js`. Add the following code to that file:

```javascript
# src/person.js

function Person(attr) {
  this.weight = attr.weight;
  this.height = attr.height;
};
```

If you run your tests again, by reloading `SpecRunner.html` you'll see that our two initial tests are passing. Can you see why? 




Okay, the next thing I want you to do is to right-click anywhere on the browser window and choose `Inspect` from the pop-up menu. That opens the developer console. Try creating a new instance of a `Person` by following the example below.



Cool, the browsers console can function as a way to manually tests your units and functions - similarly to ruby's `irb`. 

Let's write some more tests. 

```javascript
# spec/person_spec.js

it("should calculate BMI value", function() {
  person.calculate_bmi();
  expect(person.bmiValue).equal(26.01)
});

it("should have a BMI Message", function() {
  person.calculate_bmi();
  expect(person.bmiMessage).equal("Overweight")
});
```

In those tests, we are calling a `calculate_bmi()` function on the `person` object we have created. This will fail since we have no such function defined.

We extend the `Person` function by using `prototype`, similar to class methods in Ruby.

```javascript
# src/person.js

Person.prototype.calculate_bmi = function() {
  this.bmiValue = 26.01;
  this.bmiMessage = "Overweight"
};
```

That implementation will make the test pass, but it is not what we want, is it? We have just passed in some hard coded values into that function. 

Let's instead call the `BMICalculator` to do the calculation for us by changing the code to:

```javascript
# src/person.js

Person.prototype.calculate_bmi = function() {
  calculator = new BMICalculator();
  calculator.metric_bmi(this);
};
```
Here we are instantiating a new `BMICalculator` object and calling a function we call `metric_bmi` on it. We are also passing in the current instance of Person to that function. At this point, we need to shift our attention to the other spec file we need and test the behaviour of the `BMICalculator`.

### Review and reflect

1. Explain what `this` is in the context of an instance of a `Person` object.
2. Make sure you run through the whole code manually using the browsers console. What happens if you reload the page?
