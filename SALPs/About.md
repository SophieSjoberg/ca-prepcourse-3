### WEEKLY SELF ASSESSMENT AND  LEARNING PLAN 



As a big team of learners we believe it is very important that insights are shared into our learning processes so that we can all improve together. 

If there is any feedback you would like to give on your Craft Academy experience that you would prefer to go direct to a member of the team, then please message us directly on Slack. Wherever possible we'd prefer to get feedback in open forums where it can be discussed with the appropriate groups.

The Craft Academy self assessment and learning plan is used to summarize 4 key points about your week. This, coupled with our learning objectives will help you easily monitor your own progress, gain assistance from your peers and our team where needed and also provide feedback to your colleagues where you can too!

If you all need help to complete this, lean on your mentors or grab a member of the Craft Academy team at anytime!

**Make sure that you revisit this section of the prep course every week and add write the SALP**
