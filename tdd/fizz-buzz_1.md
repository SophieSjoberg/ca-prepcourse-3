## Fizz-Buzz

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.  Players take turns counting up from one, replacing any number that is divisible by three with the word 'fizz', any number divisible by five with the word 'buzz', and any number divisible by both three and five to be replaced with 'fizz buzz'.

** Our objective is to write a ruby program that simulates the Fizz Buzz game ** 

### Requirement of Fizz-buzz
The objective is to write a program that takes a number or an array of numbers and returns “fizz”, “buzz”, “fizzbuzz” or the number (greater than zero) given certain conditions are fullfilled.

####Conditions
Return: 
* “fizz” if the number is divisible by 3
* “buzz” if the number is divisible by 5
* “fizzbuzz” if the number is divisible by 15
* the same number if no other requirement is fulfilled

#### Sample output

```
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz ... etc up to 100 
```
