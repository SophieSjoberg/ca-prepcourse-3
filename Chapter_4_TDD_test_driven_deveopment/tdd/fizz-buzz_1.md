## Fizz-Buzz

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. 



Players take turns counting up from one, replacing any number that is divisible by three with the word 'fizz', any number divisible by five with the word 'buzz', and any number divisible by both three and five to be replaced with 'fizz buzz'.

** Our objective is to write a ruby program that simulates the Fizz Buzz game **

### Requirement of Fizz-buzz

The objective is to write a program that takes a number or an array of numbers and returns “fizz”, “buzz”, “fizzbuzz” or the number \(greater than zero\) given certain conditions are fullfilled.

#### Conditions

Return:

* “fizz” if the number is divisible by 3
* “buzz” if the number is divisible by 5
* “fizzbuzz” if the number is divisible by 15
* the same number if no other requirement is fulfilled

#### Sample output

```
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz ... etc up to 100
```

### User stories

In Test-Driven Development, we employ User Stories to describe what our program's users need and want. They are little "stories" that help guide our programming so that we build only what is necessary.

Here are examples of user stories that will set the scope of our fizz buzz program.

```
As a programmer
So that the game can be played according to the rules
I want a normal number to return that number
```

```
As a programmer
So that the game can be played according to the rules
I want a number divisible by three to return 'fizz'
```

```
As a programmer
So that the game can be played according to the rules
I want a number divisible by five to return 'buzz'
```

```
As a programmer
So that the game can be played according to the rules
I want a number divisible by fifteen to return 'fizz buzz'
```
