# How to Take this Prep Course

 These materials are a way for us to make sure all incoming bootcamp students have a solid foundation from which to begin their programming education. We expect this course to require 15-20 hours from you each week. Students who have prior programming or computer experience may need less time, but hopefully when you start the main course, everyone will be on even footing.
 
#### How to study these materials
  1. (Only for Craft Academy bootcamp students:) Make sure you register for a Slack account and join the Craft Academy team. If you haven't received instructions for such, write us at info@craftacademy.se to get signed up. You can always ask the coaches for help and links to demonstrations and office hours will be posted there - make sure you check in regularly!
  2. Read through the materials in each section carefully, and follow any instructions.
  2. The end of each section contains additional resources and exercises - do them! If you skip the extra materials _you will start behind_. We have linked to many helpful lessons, articles and videos because the internet has an enormous wealth of resources about learning to program. Not only do we not want to reinvent the wheel, but it's important for you to be able to digest various materials. 
  3. Take notes! It is absolutely impossible to remember everything just from reading, or even from typing. That is not the way human brains operate. Get a notebook (or a program on your computer, if that's your style) and take lots and lots of notes. You will thank yourself later.
  3. (Only for students enrolled in the Craft Academy bootcamp:) If you get stuck, ask for help in Slack. There is almost always a coach ready to help you if you have a problem. If you are not on Slack, write us at info@craftacademy.se and we'll get you up and running.
  4. Participate in the weekly demos. If the timing doesn't work for you, let Amber know and we can discuss as a group if there is a better time for demos and office hours.
  5. Do not wait to start this course! It can seem, flipping through the pages, that you will be able to complete everything quickly. Don't fall for this trap. At the end of each section, we have significant further study materials. If you wait too long to start you won't finish in time and not only will we be mad, but you will struggle in the _much more difficult_ main bootcamp.
