### INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING 

**Introducing you to the magic that is web development during 4 weeks.**

The path to success starts with preparation

The aim is to introduce you to the world of programming and get you into the habit of coding. As a student, you'll work from day one with automated testing, continuous integration and deployment, and other essential skills. This means that if and when you enter the workforce and are faced with a problem, your instinct will be to solve intelligently rather than just hacking a solution together.



By finishing this course you'll develop a strong understanding of the fundamentals of programming.
