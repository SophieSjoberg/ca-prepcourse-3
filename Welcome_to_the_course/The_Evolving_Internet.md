Alright, You've made it this far. Great. The OpenEdX interface allows us to share the entire course content with you, mostly in the form of text and video. From time to time we will also ask you to complete some quizzes or submit answers to a survey. 

You should get into the habit of reading text instructions thoroughly and pick out the essential parts. That skill will take you a while to develop and you will be amazed how easy it is to misunderstand certain words and expressions as well as overinterpret others. But let's face those situations when we get there.

At the moment we would like you to read a part of a textbook and answer a few questions afterward. The content is not directly connected to the topics we will be covering in the camp, but it is related. **The purpose of this exercise is to get into the flow of reading and understanding technical texts.** 

Please follow this link and read through the material.  On the next section, you will be asked to complete a quiz.
