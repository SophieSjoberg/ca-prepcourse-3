### Holistic attitude
Although in-depth knowledge of a particular programming language or system is important, an ability to look at the overall structure and understand the writing and rebuilding of different applications, not only from a technical but also from an business perspective, is highly sought by the market.

### Communication skills
You should be able to show that you understand and can communicate the big picture. To all sorts of stakeholders - both technical and non-technical.

### Teaching, mentoring, and knowledge sharing
Mentoring is an essential skill. In addition to managing and motivating yourself and people on your team, it's also important that you can help others learn, grow and become more effective in their jobs.
Mentoring can be a rewarding experience for you, both personally and professionally. You can improve your leadership and communication skills, learn new perspectives and ways of thinking, advance your career, and gain a great sense of personal satisfaction. During your time at Craft Academy you will be given plenty of opportunities to do code reviews, run presentations, be a mentor. Make sure you see that as a learning experience and an opportunity to grow.
