# Ruby Exercises

* Use chapter 1 of [Chris Pine's, Learn to Program book ](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_01.html) and go through the examples and exercises there on simple arithmetic in programming.
* Go through the entire [Codecademy Ruby course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby). This is going to take a while, but stick with it! If it needs to bleed over into next week a bit, that's ok. The better you can code in Ruby, the easier this course is going to be for you. Remember to take notes!
* **When you are done with the **`my_group`** exercise, upload your work to Github and paste a link in Slack.**
