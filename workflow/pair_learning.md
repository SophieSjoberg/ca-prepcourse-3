## Pair Learning
Pair Programming is an software development technique in which two programmers work together on one feature or problem set - often at one workstation. Used as part of a general teamwork approach it leads to improved code quality, team communication, knowledge share and huge learning gains. Pair Programming can be done both on-site as well as remotely. There are several PP techniques and we will be using several of them during the course. 

At Craft Academy, we practice Pair Programming as a learning technique.
