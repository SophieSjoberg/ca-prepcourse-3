# Git Exercises

### Labs - Git Immersion
There is a very good resource available on-line that allows you to practice your git skills called [Git Immersion Labs](http://gitimmersion.com/lab_01.html). Head over to their website and work your way through the first twenty labs. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully and push up your work to your GitHub account.

If you get ambitious, of course you can keep working and complete all the labs. But after twenty, we start getting into material that will be more complicated. Consider coming back to Git Immersion at the end of this prep course or during the bootcamp itself.

**Note that we have covered some of the steps included in Git Immersion, but please go over everything again. Git is a very important skill to master if you want to succeed with the Craft Academy course.**
