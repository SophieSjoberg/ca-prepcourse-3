### Week One - The Terminal, Development Environment, Version Control

During this Chapter, we will learn how to use our terminal - a way to give our computer commands directly. We'll also set up our developer environment so we can start coding and work with version control for good project management.

Note! Please follow the instructions carefully step by step. If you run into a problem ask us in the Slack channel by formulating your question and we will help you get up and running.
