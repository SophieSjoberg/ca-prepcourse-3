## Pair Learning
Pair Programming is an software development technique in which two programmers work together on one feature or problem set - often at one workstation. Used as part of a general teamwork approach it leads to improved code quality, team communication, knowledge share and huge learning gains. Pair Programming can be done both on-site as well as remotely. There are several PP techniques and we will be using several of them during the course. 

At Craft Academy, we practice Pair Programming as our primary learning technique.
