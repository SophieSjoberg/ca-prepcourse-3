## Step 8 - The Person

At this step we want to create a Person class and give him 3 attributes: `:name`, `:cash` and `:account`. We will give you a basic set of specs for that class. Your job will be to implement the code that will make these specs pass.

```
As a ATM operator      
In order to keep track of our costumers     
We want to assign each account to a separate person
```

Remember, you are free to modify these specs if you find any flaws in it OR if you find another way of testing the same behavior.

!FILENAME spec/person\_spec.rb

```ruby
require './lib/person'
require './lib/atm'

describe Person do

  subject { described_class.new(name: 'Thomas') }

  it 'is expected to have a :name on initialize' do
    expect(subject.name).not_to be nil
  end

  it 'is expected to raise error if no name is set' do
    expect { described_class.new }.to raise_error 'A name is required'
  end

  it 'is expected to have a :cash attribute with value of 0 on initialize' do
    expect(subject.cash).to eq 0
  end

  it 'is expected to have a :account attribute' do
    expect(subject.account).to be nil
  end

  describe 'can create an Account' do
    # As a Person,
    # in order to be able to use banking services to manage my funds,
    # i would like to be able to create a bank account
    before { subject.create_account }
    it 'of Account class ' do
      expect(subject.account).to be_an_instance_of Account
    end

    it 'with himself as an owner' do
      expect(subject.account.owner).to be subject
    end
  end

  describe 'can manage funds if an account been created' do
    let(:atm) { Atm.new }
    # As a Person with a Bank Account,
    # in order to be able to put my funds in the account ,
    # i would like to be able to make a deposit
    before { subject.create_account }
    it 'can deposit funds' do
      expect(subject.deposit(100)).to be_truthy
    end

  describe 'can not manage funds if no account been created' do
    # As a Person without a Bank Account,
    # in order to prevent me from using the wrong bank account,
    # I should NOT be able to to make a deposit.
    it 'can\'t deposit funds' do
      expect { subject.deposit(100) }.to raise_error(RuntimeError, 'No account present')
    end
  end
end
```

**Making all of these tests pass will bring you closer to completing this challenge.**
